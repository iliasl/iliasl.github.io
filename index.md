I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at [Samsung AI](https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_cambridge){:target="_blank"}. 
Before,  I was as Senior Researcher at [Telefonica Research](http://www.tid.es/research){:target="_blank"} and a research fellow at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}. I received my PhD from [University College London (UCL)](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/home/){:target="_blank"} under the supervision of [Cecilia Mascolo](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/){:target="_blank"}.


 My research interests include mobile systems, deep learning and networks. At Samsung AI I am leading the efforts to optimize mobile systems and software in order to support on-device AI. Furthermore, I conduct research to enable edge and cloud offloading of complex AI tasks from resource-constrained devices such as wearable and IoT. Finally, I am also interested on using AI to optimize and monitor wireless and cellular networks. 


 I also teach courses on “Deep Learning”, "Data Science" and  "Machine Learning” at the [Graduate School of Economics Masters Course in Data Science](http://www.barcelonagse.eu/study/masters-programs/data-science){:target="_blank"}  in Barcelona and at the [GSE Data Science Summer School](http://www.barcelonagse.eu/study/summer-school/data-science){:target="_blank"} .


Finally, I have been the chair or TPC member in multiple top-tier conferences (WWW, Mobisys, MobiCom, CoNext, ICWSM, CSCW, IMC, etc).

#### We are hiring!
I am keen to hear from strong students interested in doing an internship with me. Furthermore, I am looking for postdoctoral researchers that work in the intersection of mobile systems and machine learning. Please [contact me](mailto:iliasl@gmail.com) for more information.
