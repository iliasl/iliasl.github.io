I am a Staff AI Research Scientist at Meta (London), where I work within the GenAI organization (AI Frontier) on advancing the development of large language models. My current focus lies in building robust evaluation frameworks, AI judges, and reward models to support the training and assessment of cutting-edge generative AI systems.

Previously, I held senior research roles across both industry and academia. I was a Principal Research Scientist and Research Manager at [Samsung AI](https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_cambridge), a Senior Researcher at [Telefonica Research](http://www.tid.es/research), and a Research Fellow at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/). I earned my PhD in Computer Science from [University College London (UCL)](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/home/), under the supervision of [Cecilia Mascolo](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/).

My research spans large language models (post-training, evaluation, reinforcement learning), AI and machine learning systems, as well as mobile and distributed systems. At Samsung AI, I led a team focused on enabling AI at the edge, with work in distributed computing, model distillation, federated learning, computation offloading, and on-device personalization.

In parallel, I teach graduate-level courses on Deep Learning, Data Science, and Machine Learning at the [Barcelona School of Economics (BSE)](http://www.barcelonagse.eu/study/masters-programs/data-science), both during the academic year and at the [BSE Summer School](http://www.barcelonagse.eu/study/summer-school/data-science).

I remain deeply engaged with the research community, serving regularly as chair and program committee member for top-tier conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, WWW, MobiSys, MobiCom, CoNext, ICWSM, CSCW, and IMC.
